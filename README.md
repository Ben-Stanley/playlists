# Playlist manager

A simple app created to manage playlists within your apple music account.

Currently it's using mock data to highlight the functionality. This is due to not being in a position to obtain a paid apple developer account that would give me access to MusicKit that allows the ability to call Apple music APIs.
In the future I would like to get a developer account and update the codebase to add API functionality utilising Axios and Tanstack Query.

## Project setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run
